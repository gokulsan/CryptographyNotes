The design of Dilithium is based on the "Fiat-Shamir with Aborts" technique of Lyubashevsky which uses rejection sampling to make lattice-based Fiat-Shamir schemes compact and secure. The scheme with the smallest signature sizes using this approach is the one of Ducas, Durmus, Lepoint, and Lyubashevsky which is based on the NTRU assumption and crucially uses Gaussian sampling for creating signatures.
