NTRU encryption and decryption methods are different. The encryption procedure uses a mixing system based on polynomial algebra and reduction modulo two numbers p and q, while the decryption procedure uses an unmixing system whose validity depends on elementary probability theory. 

The security of the NTRU public key cryptosystem comes from  the interaction of the polynomial mixing system with the independence of reduction modulo p and q. Security also relies on the fact that for most lattices, it is very difficult to find extremely short vectors.
