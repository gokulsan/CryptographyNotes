## One Time Signature to Full Fledged Signature
- Using standard techniques, the one-time signature can be transformed into a full-fledged signature scheme using a signature-tree with only an additional work factor of O(log n).

## Fiat Shamir Tranform for generating digital signature
- A different way of constructing digital signature schemes is to first construct an identification scheme of a certain form and then convert it to a signature scheme using the Fiat-Shamir transform.
